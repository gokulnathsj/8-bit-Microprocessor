# 8-bit-Microprocessor

This is an 8-bit Microprocessor coded in verilog which can do simple calculations like addition, substraction and multiplication. It is completely developed from scratch using different modules like Program counter, RAM, Instruction Register, Control Unit, Accumulator etc where each module itself is coded independently and then integrated using a main module.
